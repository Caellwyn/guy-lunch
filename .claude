# Claude AI Instructions - Tuesday Lunch Scheduler

## Project Overview
Web application automating weekly lunch coordination for a 25-member business networking group.
See `Tuesday_Lunch_Scheduler_Project_Plan.md` for full requirements and phases.
See `technical_guide.md` for current app architecture

---

## Available Tools

### Railway CLI
- Deployed services accessible via `railway` CLI
- **Project:** Linked to this repository's remote (auto-deploy on push)
- **PostgreSQL database:** Connected and ready for initialization
- Use for deployments, database operations, and service management

### Claude CLI (Sub-agents)
- Can spawn additional Claude instances via bash: `claude <task>`
- **Allowed for:** Parallel coding tasks when files don't overlap
- **WARNING:** Coordinate which files each agent touches to avoid conflicts
- **Best practice:** Assign distinct components/files to each sub-agent

---

## Documentation Structure

**4 Core Documents (NO NEW SUMMARY FILES):**

1. **`.claude`** (this file) - AI-focused quick reference and rules
2. **`technical_guide.md`** - Updated after each completed/tested step; implementation details
3. **`Tuesday_Lunch_Scheduler_Project_Plan.md`** - Development progress tracker; check off tasks as completed
4. **`README.md`** - Human-focused; usage instructions, setup, standard README content

---

## Development Rules

### 1. No New Summary Documents
- Integrate all updates into one of the 4 core documents
- Summarize progress in chat, not new files

### 2. Development Pattern
Follow this cycle for all work:
```
PLAN → CODE → TEST → DOCUMENT → COMMIT
```
- Plan: Understand the task, identify files to change
- Code: Implement the changes
- Test: Verify it works (run tests, manual verification)
- Document: Update technical_guide.md and/or other docs
- Commit: Git commit with clear message

### 3. Ask for Help
- Don't stay stuck - escalate to user (supervisor)
- When asking for help, provide:
  - Summary of the problem
  - What you've tried
  - Results/error messages
  - Your best hypothesis

### 4. No File Deletion
- Archive files instead of deleting: move to `_archive/` directory
- Preserve for potential later restoration

### 5. No Rollbacks Without Approval
- **NEVER** run `git reset`, `git revert`, or `git stash` without explicit user approval
- These can cause permanent loss of work
